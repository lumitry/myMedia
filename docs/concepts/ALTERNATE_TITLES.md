# Alternate Titles

A user can set alternate titles for entries.

This is useful mostly for foreign media like anime and manga, where the original title is in a different language and has a translation, or multiple translations.

By storing these with a certain type, we can dynamically change which title is displayed based on the user's preferences. If you want to view all your anime in Kanji, you can do that. If you prefer the romaji, that's fine too. If you want the official english localization, that's also an option.

## Types

- **Official**: The official title, as defined by the creator or publisher.
- **Official Romanization**: The romanized version of the title, for languages that don't use the user's alphabet.
- **Official Translation**: The official translation of the title.
- **Common Name**: A common name for the entry, if it has one. Examples include "The Slime Isekai" for *That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime*, or "The Office" for *The Office (US)*.
- **Acronym/Abbreviation**: Kimetsu no Yaiba -> KnY, Shingeki no Kyojin -> SnK, etc.
- **Shortened**: A shortened version, not to be confused with an acronym. Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka -> DanMachi, and so on.
- **Literal Translation**: Sometimes the official translation differs from the direct translation. "Youjo Senki" literally translates to "The Military Chronicles of a Young Girl", but the official translation is "The Saga of Tanya the Evil".
- **Romanization**: An unofficial romanization, useful if there is no official romanization or if unofficial ones exist.
- **Other**: Any other type of alternate title.

That should cover pretty much every possible alternate title. If you can think of any more, please let me know.
